Rate-Limiting-strategies

This is an implementation of stretegies to implement rate imiting algorithm in typescript.

These strategies include
1. Token bucket algorithm
2. Leaky bucket algorithm

You can run these api in their respective folder, and follow the steps:
1. ```npm install```
2. ```npm run dev```

after this, you should be good to go testing out the implementation with api clients like Postman
or thunderclient, or even another script that will continuousely ping the server for response
and loggin them on the terminal.

Note
1. This implementation is not supposed to be used in production, so take this as a boilerplate code for implementation
2. Every code needs to be tweeked to your own needs, feel free to fork this repo to make your own changes and create a PR if need be.
